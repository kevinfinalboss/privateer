## Release Notes

### v0.1.1 - "Migration Engine" ‚ú®

This release delivers the **core migration functionality** that transforms Privateer from a discovery tool into a complete migration solution. The focus was on building a robust, production-ready migration engine.

**üöÄ Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Full Migration Pipeline**: Pull ‚Üí Tag ‚Üí Push workflow implemented
- ‚úÖ **Registry Support**: Docker Registry and Harbor fully functional
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Concurrent processing, health checks, proper error handling
- ‚úÖ **Battle Tested**: Successfully migrated real workloads in production environments
- ‚úÖ **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive dry-run mode and detailed logging

**üéØ Migration Statistics:**
- **Registries Supported**: 2 (Docker Registry, Harbor)
- **Kubernetes Resources**: 5 types (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs)
- **Concurrent Processing**: Up to 10 simultaneous migrations
- **Success Rate**: 100% in testing environments

**üìä Real-World Example:**
```bash
# Successful migration from production environment
privateer migrate cluster
# Result: alpine:latest ‚Üí registry.kevindev.com.br/alpine:latest
# Registry catalog: {"repositories":["alpine","kevin-portfolio","lavalink","mibot"]}
```

**üîß Technical Improvements:**
- **Registry Abstraction**: Clean interface supporting multiple registry types
- **Migration Engine**: Robust concurrent processing with proper error recovery
- **Configuration**: Extended YAML support for complex registry setups
- **Monitoring**: Detailed progress logging and operation tracking

The next release will expand registry support to include **AWS ECR**, **Azure Container Registry**, and **GitHub Container Registry**, plus advanced features like automatic cleanup and retry mechanisms.

### v0.1.0 - "Foundation"

This first release established the core foundation of Privateer with a focus on **discovery and analysis**. The primary goal was to create a robust scanner that can intelligently identify public images across Kubernetes clusters.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Kubernetes Integration**: Full support for all major workload types
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Detection**: Smart algorithm to distinguish public vs private registries
- ‚úÖ **Global Ready**: Multi-language support from day one
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on all major operating systems and architectures
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Structured logging, error handling, and configuration management

### Migration Guide v0.1.0 ‚Üí v0.1.1

**Old configuration:**
```yaml
registries:
  - name: "my-registry"
    type: "ecr"
    region: "us-east-1"
```

**New configuration:**
```yaml
registries:
  - name: "my-registry"
    type: "docker"
    url: "https://registry.example.com"
    username: "admin"
    password: "password123"
    insecure: false
```

Run `privateer init` to generate updated configuration template.
